            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rapids was founded in the early 2000s by two childhood friends with a shared love for rivers, teamwork, and the simple joy of outdoor adventure. What began as weekend explorations with a homemade raft and a deep respect for nature quickly grew into a calling: to help others experience the wonder, challenge, and beauty of the river.<br>
                Their first tours were humble—just a few friends, a borrowed paddle, and a lot of heart. But word spread quickly. People came not just for the thrill of whitewater, but for the sense of unity, reflection, and renewal that came with each journey down the stream.<br>
                Over the years, Rapids has grown into a trusted name in outdoor adventure, known for its commitment to safety, integrity, and joyful experiences rooted in respect for creation. While the gear has improved and the rivers have changed, the spirit remains the same:<br>
                To paddle with purpose. To serve with joy. To let the river remind us who we are.</p>
